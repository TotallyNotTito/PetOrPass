Tito Reinhart Journal

For this project, Kelsey and I have been in sync every step of the way, and have reviewed every line of code in this repository. 
We both had syncs and reviews 1 - 2 times a week on average, and met in person several times during the term for coding sessions. 
Kelsey has prior experience with webdev / site testing, where my experience is mostly in python development and cloud storage interfaces, 
including using docker containers for applications. Initially I had set out to also work on the authentication piece of this project 
which I initially had templated in the beginning of the project. Once Kelsey and I had worked indepedently, we would review changes and 
merge the code in to the main branch - pretty typical work flow. Much of the initial work I committed, Kelsey reviewed and would change as
necessary, and vice-versa. However, Kelsey's experiencec really left little for me to change. 

I would describe my contributions as being similar to rough drafts / feature implementations which Kelsey would review and augment to 
work for the application. She has the expertise in web appliation design and development, and deferred often to her approach since she's 
enormously talented and pushed the needle on getting the application. I did my best to support in working on the Flask Application design 
and using the route endpoints to pass data from the application to the minio image buckets. Additionally, earlier in the term, I had 
worked on the docker-compose file to generate the different services needed. Kelsey was gracious in quickly implementing the Dockerfiles 
for each relevant microservice that needed to be built, and reformatted the compose.yml file to get everything working perfectly. 

Additionally, When working with Auth0, we had a bit of a journey in configuring this. Much of the Minio / Authentication paramaters were 
done by a mix of doc reading and trial and error. In fact, most of this project was similar in trial and error iteration. We had difficulties 
with the multipart functionality for passing an image. What I felt most comfotable with was creating a python module to be used as our
Flask application. I have serious time limitations given my work/school schedule, and Kelsey helped a lot with consistently adding features 
and functionality, while also reviewing my code and editing changes to make it work with the larger application framework. Overall, learned a lot
especially knowing I still have a lot more to learn.

# Pet Or Pass

Remember "Hot or Not"? Pet or Pass is just like that, but for our furry (or scaly or slimy or feathered) friends! Users can review images of animals and decide if they want to pet them or if they would rather take a pass. After the user rates an image, the average score for the pet will be displayed. Users are also able to submit pet images to be judged as well as view a gallery of all the pets they have submitted with their average scores. In order to access the site, users must first log in. The site has responsive design and can be viewed comfortably on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
